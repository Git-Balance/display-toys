# Plan for startup-widget

## General notes
- Make a ~~simple "widget"~~ have multiple widgets (like the one in `dunesh`) that run on the creation of a terminal
- It should look similar to `dunesh` or `neofetch`
## What it will have
- A calendar
- Current date and time
- Battery percentage
- Uptime
- ~~Wifi and bluetooth status~~
## Future Plans
- [ ] Make a function that places multiline commands like `cal` side by side, so that the widgets are able to be placed better
EX:
|---------| |------------|
 24 of May   100% Battery
|---------| |------------|

- [ ] After making the previous plan's function, separate statusWidget into 2 separate widgets
