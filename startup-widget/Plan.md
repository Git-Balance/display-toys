# Plan for startup-widget

## General notes
- Make a simple "widget" (like the one in `dunesh`) that runs on the creation of a terminal
- It should look similar to `dunesh` or `neofetch`
## What it will have
- A calendar
- Current date and time
- Battery percentage
- Uptime
- Wifi and bluetooth status
